# Hangman

Swift implementation of the Hangman game using UIKit.

You must guess the word (chosen at random from the 'words' file) by clicking on the letters you think may be part of the word. Letters on which you've already clicked disappear from the view. You have 8 tries and if you cannot complete the word by the end of those tries, you lose. The app will then tell you what the correct word was.
